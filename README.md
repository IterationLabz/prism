## Why Prism?

Most AI chat apps lock you into a single provider. Prism doesn't. Add API keys for as many providers as you want, switch between them mid-conversation, or point Prism at your own local Ollama server. Your chats, your keys, your machine — nothing leaves your device.

---

## Features

## Supported Providers

### Direct API Mode

Bring your own API keys. Models are shown automatically when a key is saved.

| Category | Providers |
|----------|-----------|
| **Major** | OpenAI · Anthropic · Google Gemini |
| **Fast inference** | Groq · Cerebras · Fireworks AI |
| **Open-source** | DeepSeek · Moonshot (Kimi) · Qwen · Mistral · xAI (Grok) |
| **Aggregators** | OpenRouter |

Click the **⟳** button in the top bar to fetch the live model list from each provider's API — including any new models added after release.

### Custom Endpoint Mode

Point Prism at any OpenAI-compatible URL. Models are auto-detected from `/v1/models`.

| Server | Default URL |

## Pre-built Downloads

Don't want to build from source? Grab the latest installer for your OS from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/IterationLabz/prism/releases) page.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
node --version   # Must be 18.0.0 or higher
npm --version    # Must be 9.0.0 or higher
git --version    # Any recent version
```

> **Important:** Prism relies on native C/C++ Node modules (`better-sqlite3` and `nodejs-whisper`). To build from source, you **must** have native build tools installed on your system:
> - **macOS**: `xcode-select --install`
> - **Windows**: Install Visual Studio Build Tools with the "Desktop development with C++" workload
> - **Linux**: `sudo apt install build-essential python3`

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IterationLabz/prism.git
cd prism
npm install
```

### 2. Run in Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This launches Prism with hot-reload enabled. On first launch, you'll see an onboarding screen where you can choose between Direct API mode (enter your own API keys) or Custom Endpoint mode (point to a local server like Ollama). Changes to renderer code update instantly; main process changes trigger an automatic restart.

### 3. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles the main process, preload script, and renderer into optimized bundles in the `out/` directory.

### 4. Package for Your OS

```bash
npm run package
```

This runs a production build and then packages it into an installable file for your current operating system. The output appears in `dist/`.

Platform-specific packaging commands are also available:

```bash
npm run package:mac     # macOS (.dmg for both Apple Silicon and Intel)
npm run package:win     # Windows (.exe NSIS installer)
npm run package:linux   # Linux (.AppImage)
```

> **Note on Windows Releases:** Automated GitHub Action releases currently skip Windows packaging due to CI file-size memory constraints during ASAR bundling of local TTS models. If you need Prism on Windows, simply clone the repo and run `npm run package:win` locally on your machine—it will compile perfectly.

> **Note:** You can only package for the OS you're running on. To package for a different OS, run the package command on that OS.

### 5. Install the Packaged App

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS</strong></summary>

1. Open the `.dmg` file from `dist/`
2. Drag **Prism** to your **Applications** folder
3. On first launch, macOS will block it because it's unsigned. To bypass:
   - **Right-click** (or Control-click) the app → **Open** → click **Open** in the dialog
   - Or run this command in Terminal:
     ```bash
     xattr -cr /Applications/Prism.app
     ```
4. After the first open, it will launch normally going forward

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

1. Run the `Prism Setup x.x.x.exe` installer from `dist/`
2. If Windows SmartScreen blocks it:
   - Click **More info**
   - Click **Run anyway**
3. Choose your installation directory and complete the setup

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Linux</strong></summary>

1. Make the AppImage executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x Prism-x.x.x.AppImage
   ```
2. Run it:
   ```bash
   ./Prism-x.x.x.AppImage
   ```

</details>

## Architecture

```
src/
├── main/                 # Electron main process
│   ├── index.ts          # Window creation, app lifecycle
│   ├── db.ts             # SQLite via better-sqlite3
│   ├── ipc.ts            # IPC handlers (settings, chats, models)
│   └── llm.ts            # Provider routing, streaming, model fetching
├── preload.ts            # Context bridge (main ↔ renderer)
├── shared/
│   └── config.ts         # Shared types and defaults
└── renderer/
    └── src/
        ├── App.tsx
        ├── store.ts              # Zustand state
        ├── hooks/
        │   └── useEndpointModels.ts
        └── components/
            ├── TopBar.tsx        # Provider → model selector
            ├── SettingsModal.tsx  # Keys, endpoint, preferences
            ├── Sidebar.tsx       # Chat list
            ├── ChatWindow.tsx    # Messages + composer
            └── OnboardingModal.tsx
```

All API keys and chat data stay on your machine. The renderer never touches Node.js APIs directly — everything goes through IPC.

---

## Security

- API keys are stored in a local SQLite database in your OS user data directory
- Keys are sent only to the provider you choose — never to us or any third party
- Renderer runs with `contextIsolation: true` and `nodeIntegration: false`
- External URLs open via `shell.openExternal` through IPC — no renderer-side navigation

---

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS: "developer cannot be verified" warning</strong></summary>

Prism is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate. On first launch, macOS will block it.

**Fix:** Right-click the app → **Open** → click **Open** in the confirmation dialog. Alternatively, run:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Prism.app
```

This only needs to be done once.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Models not loading in Custom Endpoint mode</strong></summary>

1. **Verify your server is running** — try `curl http://localhost:11434/v1/models` in your terminal
2. **Check the URL format** — it must end in `/v1` (e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1`, not just `http://localhost:11434`)
3. **For Ollama** — make sure you've pulled at least one model: `ollama pull llama3`
4. **Fallback** — if auto-detection fails, use the "✏ Custom model…" option in the model dropdown and type the model name manually

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Ollama CORS errors</strong></summary>

If you see CORS-related errors in the console when connecting to Ollama:

```bash
OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*" ollama serve
```

Or set the environment variable permanently in your shell profile.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Streaming seems to hang</strong></summary>

- **Check your API credits** — most providers return errors silently when credits are exhausted
- **Reasoning models take longer** — models like `o1`, `o3`, and `deepseek-reasoner` think before responding. Wait 10–30 seconds.
- **Check the terminal** — if you launched with `npm run dev`, main process errors appear in the terminal where you ran the command

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>better-sqlite3 or nodejs-whisper native module errors</strong></summary>

If you see errors about `better-sqlite3` or `nodejs-whisper` failing to load native bindings after install:

```bash
npm run postinstall
```

If that doesn't work, ensure you have the native build tools installed (see Prerequisites), then do a clean reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

</details>
